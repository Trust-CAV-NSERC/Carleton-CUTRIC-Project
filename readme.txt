The Canadian Urban Transit Research & Innovation Consortium (CUTRIC) is a socially responsible non-profit organization that spearheads, designs, and launches technology and commercialization projects that advance next-generation zero-carbon mobility and transportation solutions across Canada.

We are solicited by CUTRIC to provide study into Pandemic Research Proposal on Disinfection Robot for Train Bus Room. Following code is meant to analyze the COVID-19 related virus strain.

This program is a Python program. Please install the Python3.x version from the Python official website before running. After installation, enter "py /file directory/protein_trans.py" in the terminal to run the program (run the command line with the commands supported by the version you installed. Please refer to the documentation of the installed version by yourself).

Program function: Convert the protein (amonia acid) sequence to the value of the corresponding label (biological property), and output it in a format that can be manipulated in an Excel sheet table.
Program input: 1. Enter the protein sequence that needs to be converted. Since the original data does not undergo format preprocessing, it does not support direct reading from the file yet. If you need to read in from a file, please add the read code yourself.
                  2. Enter the label type required for this conversion (mass, charge or isoelectric point).
                  3. Enter the desired output method: output to the screen or output to a document.
Program output: You can choose to output to the screen or file.
                  **If you choose to output to a document, please note that all "C:/Users/Moran/Documents/proteins/nLabelTemp.txt" in the program should be modified to the path of the output document on your computer. In particular, you must use it in case of the Windows environment with Absolute path! !
